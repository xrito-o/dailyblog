## What is PHP?
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular open-source server-side scripting language designed for web development. It is embedded within HTML and is especially suited for creating dynamic and interactive websites.

## Why PHP?
- Easy to learn and use for beginners
- Widely supported by hosting providers
- Large community and extensive documentation
- Integrates well with databases like MySQL
- Powers many popular platforms (WordPress, Drupal, etc.)

## How does PHP work?
PHP code is executed on the server. When a user requests a PHP page, the server processes the PHP code and sends the resulting HTML to the user's browser. This allows for dynamic content generation and interaction with databases.

## Variables in PHP
Variables in PHP start with a `$` sign followed by the variable name. They are used to store data that can be manipulated throughout the script.

```php
$greeting = "Hello, World!";
echo $greeting;
```

## Data Types in PHP
PHP supports several data types:
- String
- Integer
- Float (double)
- Boolean
- Array
- Object
- NULL

```php
$name = "Alice";      // String
$age = 25;             // Integer
$price = 19.99;        // Float
$isActive = true;      // Boolean
$colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]; // Array
```

PHP is flexible and forgiving, making it a great choice for rapid web development.
